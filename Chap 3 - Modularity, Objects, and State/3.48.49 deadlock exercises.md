Suppose the accounta a1 and a2 are given ids 1 and 2. The deadlock avoidance strategy ensures that account with lower id is serialized first.

In the following scenario:
1. Peter tries to exchange a1 and a2 balance
2. Paul tries to exchange a2 and a1 balance

Deadlock can be avoided since Paul's process will try to acquire lock on a1 first. If it is already locked by Peter's process than it will wait for the lock to be released before proceeding.

If the resources that a process will require prior to execution are not known, there is no way to enforce an ordering of resources and ensure that they are accessed in a sequential order.
