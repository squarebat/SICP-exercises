```scm
(define x 10)

(define s (make-serializer))

(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
```
This serialization prevents us from resetting x's value while it is being accessed by `(lambda () (* x x))`. Hence we won't have a multiplication like 10\*11, or 11\*10. The possible values are 121, 101, 11 and 100(x=10 accessed by both processes simultaneously) 

## 3.40

```
(define x 10)

(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
                  (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))
```

Both processes can access and set the value of x simultaneously. Thus, the first process might access the values 10 and 1000(set after execution of 2nd process) and give the following values -
- 100 = 10\*10
- 10000 = 10\*1000
- 1000000 = 1000\*1000

Similarly, 2nd process can access the values 10 or 100, and give following values -
- 1000 = 10\*10\*10
- 10000 = 10\*10\*100
- 100000 = 10\*100\*100
- 1000000 = 100\*100\*100

Total possible values returned of x after parallel-execute are - 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000

If both processes are realized, only 1 possible value remains : 1000000 - either set by process 1 as 1000\*1000, or by process 2 as 100\*100\*100

## 3.41

There's no need to serialize access to `balance` unlike ben suggests, since it doesn't change the state of the bank account. Even if a call to balance is interleaved with calls to withdraw or deposit, the value acccessed will still be valid, since it is the value of either before or after the process is completed and not an intermediate value.

As explained by Mike on [Scheme Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-3.41) -
```
I believe the book uses these two requirements on concurrency:

- First, it does not require the processes to actually run sequentially, but only to produce results that are the same as if they had run sequentially.
- Second, there may be more than one possible ``correct'' result produced by a concurrent program, because we require only that the result be the same as for some sequential order. 

An "unprotected" access to balance fulfills both requirements so I would say it does not really matter. 
```

## 3.42

Every call to serializer returns a new function that accesses the same serializer. With Ben Bitdiddle's version, only two serialized functions are created - one for withdraw and deposit. With the original solution, a new serialized function is created on each call to withdraw or deposit. 

Depending on the implementation of serializer, a serialized function may or may not interleave with itself. Each function call creates a new process, if they are treated as separate under the same serializer, they won't be allowed to execute together. In which case, Ben's suggestion is safe. 

I believe the original version is safer, since how the serializer would behave is unclear.
