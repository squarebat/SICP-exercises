> Examine the stream (pairs integers integers). Can you make any general comments about the order in which the pairs are placed into the stream? For example, about how many pairs precede the pair (1,100)? the pair (99,100)? the pair (100,100)? (If you can make precise mathematical statements here, all the better. But feel free to give more qualitative answers if you find yourself getting bogged down.) 

```lisp
(define (interleave s1 s2)
  (if (stream-null? s1)
      s2
      (cons-stream (stream-car s1)
                   (interleave s2 (stream-cdr s1)))))

(define (pairs s t)
  (cons-stream
   (list (stream-car s) (stream-car t))
   (interleave
    (stream-map (lambda (x) (list (stream-car s) x))
                (stream-cdr t))
    (pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t)))))
```
Assuming that both streams S and T are integers, the `pairs` procedure would first create following streams. 
(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)....
     (1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)....
          (2,0)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)....
and so on 

Those streams will be put together by interleaving as follows (Assume only below 4 streams exist as of now)
(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)....
     (1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)....
          (2,0)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)....      | 
               (3,0)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3).... | interleave 
 
(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)....
     (1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)....
          (2,0)(3,0)(2,1)(3,1)(2,2)(3,2)....

(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)....
     (1,0)(2,0)(1,1)(3,0)(1,2)(2,1)(1,3)(3,1)(1,4)(2,2)(1,5)(3,2)....

(0,0)(1,0)(0,1)(2,0)(0,2)(1,1)(0,3)(3,0)(0,4)(1,2)(0,5)(2,1)(0,6)(1,3)(0,7)(3,1)(0,8)(1,4)(0,9)(2,2)(1,5)(3,2)....

- If we notice the interleaved stream, pairs in the first stream appear alternately
- Pairs of second stream (1,x) appear at a gap of 1+2 pairs
- Pairs of third stream (2,x) appear at a gap of 1+2+4 pairs.
- Pairs (n,x) occur at every 2^(n+1) pairs. (2^(n+1) - 1 pairs apart)   


This is because pairs of a stream are interleaved 2 more pairs apart at every recursive call to interleave

- Thus (1,100) and (1,0) are 3*100 + 100 -1 pairs apart. (1, 0) is at 2nd positions. (1,100) would be at 402nd position

- (99,100) is at 101*2^100th position
- (100,100) is at 101*2^101th position
