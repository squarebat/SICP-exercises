```lisp
(define fibs
  (cons-stream 0
               (cons-stream 1
                            (add-streams (stream-cdr fibs)
                                         fibs))))
```

Let's trace the call to (stream-ref fibs 5)
- The first element is 0
- stream-cdr evaluates (cons-stream 1 ... and next element is 1
- the next evaluation calls add-streams. The car and cdr of streams add up first and next element is 0+1 = 1
- The next stream-cdr calls (add-streams (stream-cdr (stream-cdr fibs) (stream-cdr fibs))))
- These are evaluated as 1 and 1 and next element is 2
- So on (stream-ref fibs 5) evalautes the fib streams till 5

- If delay wasn't memoized, every call to add-stream would require recomputing fibs up to the xth and x-1th term. Since addstreams is called recursively, the computations increase exponentially.
