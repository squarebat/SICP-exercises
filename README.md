# SICP-exercises
Solved exercises from the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

### So what is SICP
- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is a computer science textbook written by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman.
- It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming - recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.
- Read more about the book here [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).
- Read the book [here](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (It's freely available btw).

### Why am I reading it? (And why you should too!)
- It provides intuition into different programming paradigms and builds foundation for more advanced concepts. 
- It doesn't dive deep into the details of a single programming language, rather it teaches how to reason about the programming process. It has given me profound insight into how computer programs are formed.
- There are 100s of exercise. Each and every one of those teaches an important new idea. That's a lot of ideas.
- On the off-chance, you may also find the answer to life, the universe and everything. 
- Still unconvinced? Read [Brian Harvey's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harvey_(lecturer)) article [Why SICP Matters](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html). And [Peter Norvig's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) [review](https://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8) on SICP.
- If you know me, you have probably heard all of this. You might also be convinced that I am part of a cult, which I assure you, I am.

### Tools
- I used [Drracket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/) for the first 2 chapters of SICP. It's super simple to use and you will be able to focus completely on the exercises. Here's the [installation](https://download.racket-lang.org/) guide.
- Later, I shifted to using Emacs since I have always wanted to. I started out with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) and it is super fun. Here's a [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_iBj91eeI&t=613s) on how to get started with it. [Here](https://github.com/squarebat/SICP-exercises/blob/main/in_case_i_forget_how_to_use_emacs.md) are some useful shortcuts I use for solving the exercises.
