- ```Space .``` and open files

##### Navigating Windows
- ```Space W s``` for horizontal split
- ```Space W```
  - `j` to move to window below current
  - `k` for window up
  - `h` for left window
  - `l` for right window (confusing right?)
  - All above letters in capital (e.g `Space W J`)move the current window to desired position
  
##### Executing a Scheme program
