```scm
(define (run-forever) (run-forever))
```

- `try` runs forever if a procedure halts when given itself as input

```scm
(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))
```

- let's see the evaluation of `(try try)`
- If (halts? try try) evaluates to true, that means (try try) halts in execution. - However if the call to halts? is true, the proc (run-forever) is called, forcing the call to (try try) to never halt.
- If it never halts, then ideally the call to (try try) should return `'halted`. 
- But that means it does halt, so (run-forever) should be called.
- You get the gist.
