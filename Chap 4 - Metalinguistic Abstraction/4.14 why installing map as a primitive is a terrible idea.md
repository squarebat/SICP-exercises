## Why installing `map` as primitive can't work -
- `map` takes in as its arguments a procedure to apply to a list of values.
- Unless the procedure supplied is a primitive, it will get interpreted using our implementation of the evaluator. 
- However map will be evaluated by the underlying interpreter (Racket, Common-Lisp, MIT scheme etc) and it will try to implemnt the proc supplied in argument with the underlying implementation as well.
- This will produce terrible results, since a procedure in our implementation will be most likely structured differently than in a proc in the underlying implementation. Especially if we changed the syntax.
- Hence, map can't work as a primitive. In fact any proc that takes in arguments that are not primitive cannot be installed as a primitive.
