## Text version
- The text version of analyze sequence returns the first expression if sequence of one expression is passed
- A sequence of two expressions is analyzed as follows
```SCM
(lambda (env) (exp1 env) (exp2 env))
```

### Alyssa's version
- It returns a lambda that will call execute-sequence which will later evaluate one expression
- On two expressions, execute-sequence will execute both expressions in the list 
- At every call, we'll have to parse through the entire list of expressions in this version to execute them, whereas in the version of text, just one lambda is executed.
