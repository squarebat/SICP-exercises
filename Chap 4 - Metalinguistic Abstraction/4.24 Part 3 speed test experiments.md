## Evaluator and Analyzer Speed Test

I tested oout the interpreters on two functions, a linear recursion and a tree recursion. Since the analyzer only reads the expressions once, it should work much more faster than the evaluator for tree recursions.

```SCM
;linear recursion
(define (loop n) (if (> n 0) (loop (- n 1)) 'done))

;tree recursion
(define (pascals-triangle row index)
  (cond ((> index row) -1)
        ((= index 1) 1)
        ((= index row) 1)
        (else (+ (pascals-triangle  (- row 1) (- index 1)) (pascals-triangle  (- row 1) index))))) 
```

The results -

|  | `(loop 1000000)` | (pascals-triangle 23 12) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluator | 1m2s | 3m59s |
| Analyzer | 39.6s | 2m4s |

- The time difference between the evaluator and the analyzer grows exponentially with increase of recursive calls. 
- Yes, both interpreters are seriously inefficient, but the analyzer performs far better. 
- This is because the expressions are read once and wrapped into lambda by the analyzer. This lambda executes on every call to the proc.
- On the other hand, the evaluator reads the expressions on every call to the proc, has to recognize the type of expressions every time and then proceed to execution.
